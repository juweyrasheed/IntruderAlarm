IoT - Worksheet 3
This challenge is rather open but must include the development of a small program that in some way represents the Internet of Things.

Introduction
This is a simple remote intruder alarm. It mainly uses the accelerometer of the microbit to detect if there is any motion.

Usage
For this program, two Microbit devices and a laptop is required. It is divided into two parts: the Sensor and the receiver.

The Sensor is the Microbit that is fixed on the required object.
The Receiver is the microbit that is connected to the laptop. 

The Sender will detect any acceleration with regards to it's position and send a signal to the receiver. The receiver will them display a skull image on the device and sound an alarm to alert the user.
 
Power & Connectivity
Connect battery pack (Sender Microbit can be connected to a battery pack)
Connect via USB cable (Receiver Microbit has to be connected to laptop)


Getting Started

Setting up everything

Copy and Paste "Alarm Sensor.hex" into the sender Microbit.
Copy and Paste "Alarm Remote Control.hex" into the receiver Microbit.
Keep the receiver Microbit connected to the laptop.
Attach the sensor microbit on your required object.
Turn on the sender Microbit and test by moving the object the sensor microbit is attached to.
